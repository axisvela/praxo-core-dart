# PRAXO-CORE for Dart

PRAXO-CORE is an embeddable, MIT-licensed agent framework. This package is its native Dart Core: an agent loop with tool registration and dispatch, policy hooks, typed events, memory, checkpoints, context budgets, middleware, OTel and Harmovela sinks, MCP, retriever and synchronous delegation seams, JSON Schema validation, and plugin manifest parsing. It runs in-process and does not require a hosted service.

## Quick start

Install the published package:

```bash
dart pub add praxo_core:^0.4.0
```

```dart
import 'package:praxo_core/praxo_core.dart';

void main() {
  final agent = Agent(AgentOptions(StaticModel('hello')));
  final result = agent.run(const Session(id: 'demo'), 'hello');
  print(result.output);
}
```

See the [full Dart README](language/dart/README.md) for complete installation, build, and verification commands.

## Examples

Runnable examples live under [`language/dart/examples`](language/dart/examples).

| Example | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| [checkpoint](language/dart/examples/checkpoint) | This example uses the Dart Core checkpoint allowlist for a registered payload round trip. |
| [event-sink](language/dart/examples/event-sink) | This example uses Dart Core sink composition to fan out events and filter the tool-only stream. |
| [identity-policy](language/dart/examples/identity-policy) | This example binds a trusted principal to policy decisions and rejects missing, role-mismatched, and tenant-mismatched actions. |
| [mcp](language/dart/examples/mcp) | This example uses a caller-owned in-process transport with the Dart MCP client. |
| [provider-fallback](language/dart/examples/provider-fallback) | This example calls a fallback only after the primary fails and preserves the primary failure when both fail. |
| [retry](language/dart/examples/retry) | This example retries a transient failure with a bounded attempt count and keeps the exhausted failure state. |
| [service](language/dart/examples/service) | This example defines a transport-neutral request handler with health, principal, and run cases. |
| [streaming](language/dart/examples/streaming) | This example accumulates streamed chunks and checks that they reconstruct the final output. |
| [structured-output](language/dart/examples/structured-output) | This example validates a final JSON answer against a schema and rejects invalid output. |

## Verify

Run the checks from `language/dart`:

```bash
dart run conformance/run.dart
python api-snapshot.py --check
dart run test/run.dart
```

This mirror contains the language source and the shared `spec/` vectors, so the implementation can be built and tested here. See [`language/dart/README.md`](language/dart/README.md) for the exact commands. The monorepo CI runs conformance, API snapshot, and native tests for this implementation.
